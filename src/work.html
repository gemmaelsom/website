      <!-- Bio -->
      <p>
        <span>Hey there!</span><br />
        I'm Gemma, and I grew up between the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane. I’ve
        spent over two decades in film and theatre, and I've recently moved into
        the exciting world of Tech. I couldn't be happier with my decision.
        After winning the Theatre Award at the Darwin Fringe Festival and
        writing and producing three productions of my own, I decided to seek out
        new mediums I could create with. Even so, I largely stayed within the
        boundaries of a traditional art career, publishing my writing, producing
        shows, and participating in the performing arts community. More
        recently, I decided to push beyond the confines of a conventional
        artist’s career. Since beginning coding, I've found myself willingly
        spending 12 hours a day working on a project without noticing any time
        pass. <br />Outside of coding, I like to read, spend time with my family
        and pre-Covid I really loved to travel. My favourite things in the world
        are watching animal rescue videos, my morning coffee and when my partner
        cooks for me. I am fascinated by the modern society and I have conducted
        some social experiences through artist residencies to explore this
        further. I am in my final year of a degree in Sociology, and I'm eager
        to enter the tech industry and combine my passions to create meaningful
        work.<br />Please feel free to peruse both of my CVs, and please reach
        out to me via the form on my Contact page or on Social Media to discuss
        any ideas or opportunities you may have.
